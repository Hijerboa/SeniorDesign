For keyword extraction, everything has been changed to work off of just the summary, and full text is no longer required. There's an example script under app/scripts/ml_scripts/test_keywords.py. This includes the keyword extraction for 1000 bills, as well as an example of connecting to the database and grabbing bill objects
In terms of what needs to be done with these:

1. Wider testing, just test with more bills and figure out if the 
    keywords are sufficient 

2. Remove text like 

    (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. 
    The summary of that version is repeated here.) 
    
    from summaries. This and variations upon it appear in a large number 
    of bills--we probably want to not be getting key words from this.

4. Include the bill title, and variations upon it 
    (such as House Res 57, H Res 57, HR 57, H.R. 57, etc) as keywords

5. I'd look to see if there's way to remove "duplicate-ish" 
    keywords from the process. For instance, theres a result like this:

    ['goals ideals ', 'national suffragists day ', 'promote awareness ', 
    'right women ', 'national suffragists ', 'ideals national suffragists ', 
    'suffragists day promote ', 'women suffragists ', 'women suffragists worked ', 
    'suffragists worked ', 'women vote ', 'day promote ', 'awareness women ', 
    'supports goals '] 

    where we see the idea of national suffragists several times
